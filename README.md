#🔍 Java Port Scanner

A fast, lightweight, multi-threaded TCP port scanner written in Java.

This project is a foundational networking tool designed to explore TCP connectivity, service discovery, and basic protocol interaction. It is built as a standalone mini-project to exercise socket programming, concurrency, timeout handling, and clean CLI design in Java.

The scanner supports configurable host/port ranges, parallel execution, connection timeouts, and optional banner grabbing for service identification.
It serves as an educational precursor to more advanced network scanning tools (e.g., SYN scanning, OS detection, vulnerability mapping).
